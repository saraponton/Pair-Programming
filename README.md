#                                                    Pair Programming
## This is a pair programming project done by Katya Klymets and Sara Pont√≥n
### In this project we will attempt to write an algorith that sorts alphabetically a list of words and adds each word in its correspondent position in a _Linked List_. 

To do that we will have to code a program to read all the words from a given text file and then an algorithm to sort and store them in the Linked List.

After coding the Linked List we will have to create another file with all that information called **sorteddict.txt**
